# Challenge #2: 🏵 Token Vendor

![Speed Run Ethereum Challenge #2 thumbnail](./sre_c2.png)

## Tasks to be done

🤖 Smart contracts are kind of like "always on" *vending machines* that **anyone** can access. Let's make a decentralized, digital currency. Then, let's build an unstoppable vending machine that will buy and sell the currency.

## My Review

This was a fun challenge because I got to create my own crypto [KevinCoin](https://goerli.etherscan.io/token/0xccdba9c461ffe52b480e2899975ead2341ff70b1) which is priced at 0.01 ETH 😎 (on a testnet 🫠) This challenge essentially teaches you about the ERC 20 standards and how it works, its mechanism of approve, why it exists and so much more...

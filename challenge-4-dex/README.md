## Tasks to be done

This challenge will help you build/understand a simple decentralized exchange, with one token-pair (ERC20 BALLOONS ($BAL) and ETH).

## My Review

This was a very interesting challenge, although most of the code was pre provided this challenge helped me understand how DEXs work. Such a simple mathematical formula that makes sure that the liquidity pool never empties and also balances the cost of the tokens based on the liquidity available ‚öñÔ∏è Also my first time using the SafeMath by openzeppelin üìà
